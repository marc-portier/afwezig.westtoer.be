Westtoer Op Verlof
==================

Westtoer Op Verlof (name pending) is an application created for Westtoer - Tourism West-Flanders to manage their vacation days.
This project is currently in active development, but is in it's early stages. The code has not been optimized, or even cleaned
up! So use at own risk.


CakePHP
-------

We are using CakePHP to create this application. If you would like to spin this application yourself, feel free to
contact me at im@nielsvermaut.eu and I will guide you through the process.

UiTID in CakePHP
----------------

I am going to create a CakePHP plugin for UiTID OAuth, but if you would like to check out how I did it, you need to copy the
vendors folder into your project and you need to copy the app/Controller/UsersController.php. These will help you implement
login by UiTID.

If you want to read a walkthrough on how to configure UiTID for your CakePHP install, you can [read my blogpost](http://nielsvermaut.eu/using-uitid-oauth-to-login-in-cakephp/) about it.
